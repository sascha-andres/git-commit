This project is a configurable commit-msg hook. You can either configure using a global configuration file of a repository configuration file. If both exist, repository file will be merged into global configuration file.

The global configuration file is located in the HOME directory of the user and named `.commit-hook.yaml` while the repository specific file is in the root of the repository and named `.commit-hook.yaml`.

Both files have the same structure.

## Configuration file structure

    ---
    
    version: 2                           # version of config file
    
    subject-line-length: 50              # Length of the subject line at a maximum
    body-required: false                 # Is a body required for a commit
    separate-body: true                  # Should the body be separated by a blank line
    body-line-length: 72                 # Maximum length of body lines
    enforce-body-line-length: true       # Should too long body lines be treated as an error or as a warning
    
    ignore:                              # a list of regular expressions to ignore lines (no check)
      - ^#.*                             # ignore comments
    
    subject:                                         # Match the subject against those expressions
      - name: ensure tagging of subject              # Name of rule
        expression: ^[a-z]+(\([a-z]+\))?:.*[^\.]$    # have feat(web): bla match, no . at the end allowed
        severity: error                              # on error fail commit, else print with severity attached
    
    occurs:                              # Match somewhere, check for existence
      - TICKET-[0-9]+                    # have a TICKET-1 as a match

    external-tools:                      # external tools to run before accepting commit
      - severity: error                  # on error fail commit, else print with severity attached
        name: linter                     # name of rule
        command:                         # command to execute
          - make
          - lint


## Installation

Put the binary into your path.

## Use

### install hook

The application has a helper to install the hook:

    git-hook-commit install

You need to run this in the root of your project ( the folder containing the `.git` folder ). If there is an existing hook you have to force it ( `-f` ).

### uninstall hook

Similar to the installation process, there is an uninstall helper:

    git-hook-commit uninstall

Essentially this just removes the hook, so it would remove any other hook also. So be careful.
